# Social Media Engagement Platform

## Project Overview
This project is a social media engagement platform that generates insights on a mock social media account using various post types such as Curated Content (Curse), Ads, Static Images, and Reels. It tracks engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comment counts. The platform leverages **LangFlow** and **Austradb** for Gemini integration to analyze and derive insights from the data.


  
## Features

- **Post Types Supported:**
  - carousel 
  - Ad
  - Static Images
  - Reels
- **Gemini Integration:** Use of **Austradb** and **LangFlow** for Gemini-powered insights and data processing.


## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing
  - **ShadCN** for UI components and styling
  
- **Backend:**
  - **FastAPI** for fast API development
  
- **Data Processing & Insights:**
